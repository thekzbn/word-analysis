# Top 5000 Words
**Author**: Ayomide Deji-Adeyale (@thekzbn)  
**Project Type**: Linguistic Analysis Suite

A structural autopsy of the 5,000 most frequently used words in the English language. This tool identifies orthographic habits and phonetic skeletons through data visualization and pattern extraction.

## Core Features
- **Grapheme Analysis**: Distribution of letters across Onset, Nucleus, and Terminus positions.
- **Structural Taxonomy**: Categorization of words by Vowel-Consonant patterns (e.g., CVCV).
- **Cluster Detection**: Tracking of geminate consonants and their frequency.
- **Vowel Saturation**: Identification of phonetically complex specimens.

## Design Philosophy
This project employs the **bored** design language: expensive nothingness. It prioritizes data density, restraint, and the user as king.
- **Typography**: Inter Display Variable.
- **Palette**: The Golden Anchor (Purity, Serenity, Depth, Radiance, Heritage).
- **Geometry**: Strict 1px borders, 1rem radii, and absolute spacing scales.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript.
- **Styles**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Charts**: Recharts.
- **Animation**: Framer Motion.

## Documentation
Technical documentation for developers, including a line-by-line explanation of the analysis algorithm, is available in the `docs/` directory:
- [**Documentation Overview**](./docs/README.md)
- [**Algorithm Autopsy**](./docs/Algorithm.md)

## Development
To initialize the environment and start the analysis suite:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
